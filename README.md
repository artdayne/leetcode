Solutions to questions on LeetCode

As I re-learn programming, I want to keep a repository of my solutions for problems that I come across on Leet Code (https://leetcode.com) 

I will be using JAVA and Python mainly. If you know of a more efficient solution than the one I've created, please suggest an edit!
